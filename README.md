# Fake-News-Detection-using-Logistic-Regression

This project aims to develop an effective system for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning methods. By leveraging supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, along with deep learning models such as CNNs and RNNs, the project aims to identify patterns indicative of fake news. The approach involves preprocessing textual data, extracting various linguistic, syntactic, and semantic features such as word embeddings, sentiment analysis scores, and syntactic parse trees. Evaluation of the model is performed on benchmark datasets, including true.csv and fake.csv, using performance metrics like accuracy and F1-score. The goal is to create a scalable, reliable fake news detection system that can empower users to distinguish between credible and misleading information, ultimately contributing to a safer and more trustworthy online environment.
